I chose these because they are Russian translations, and I have two roommates that are Russian. 
We were recently talking about how one of their dads work in computer science, and their coding is done
entire in English, despite the fact that most people at their company do not speak any English at all. 
I talked with them about this assignment, and they helped me translate the keywords with the closest possible
conjugation for accuracy based on the assignment.
