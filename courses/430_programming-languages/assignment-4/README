If you want to run the tests directly in the sml interpreter, then you will
need to load the files in the following order:

evaluator.sml
test_scaffold.sml
tests.sml


Within the tests directory are a collection of files for each test case.
The .nex file is the test is a somewhat traditional syntax (for readability).
The .sml file contains the AST representation of the test case.
The .correct file is the expected output for that test case.
