# Molly Sandler Coursework
<b> My coursework from my time at Cal Poly as of June 2024 <b> <br>
While many college students work on personal projects, one of the great things about Cal Poly is its Learn By Doing mentality. While I work on both personal and professional projects too, I have had the wonderful opportunity to work in depth in all of my classes, learning a variety of languages and how to work well in teams. <br>

101 is an Intro to Computer Science course, all in Python <br>
202 is Data Structures and Algorithims, all in Python. Learned about stacks, queues, trees, linked lists, heaps, and graphs. <br>
203 is Project Based Object Oriented Design, all in Java. Project 4 is the final project, which contains all of the previous ones. Learned about interfaces, abstract classes, and other Java and OOP relevant things. We were given this assignment in procedural programming, and converted it to OOP throughout the quarter by implementing new things we learned. <br>
225 is Into to Computer Organization, in LC-3 Assembly and C. Learned how the inner workings of the computers run code, and how memory works. <br>
305 is Individual Software Development. We learned how to create medium sized projects from scratch, with functional logical components and GUIs, all in Java. <br>
308 and 309 and paired classes, Software Engineering I and II. We worked in one team for twenty weeks to create a robust and deployable program, all in Java. Also learned a lot about working with Github on branches with a team.<br>
321 is Computer Security. We learned about encryption and ciphers, brute force password cracking, public and private keys, and social engineering. We used Python to learn these lessons.<br>
357 is Systems Programming, in C and Unix. Learned more about how to use memory, as well as how to use Unix commands. Learned C syntax too. <br>
365 is Relational Databases. We were given the basic structure of a potion shop that had buyers and sellers, and had to create a functional API using it. This used Python and PostgreSQL. We also had a long term group project, where we created a Recipes API using Python and PostgreSQL for the backend, with React and Express for the frontend. We also worked on query challenges with MySQL. <br>
429 is Topics in Cybersecurity, specifically Secure Web Servers. We were tasked as a group with keeping a server up and running for the entire quarter. Other groups and our professor could attack us, and we had to mitigate these attacks. We wrote scripts shown here that alerted us if our site itself or its functionality was down, so we could limit the time down. <br>
430 is Programming Languages, which we took in metalanguage. We learned how programming languages really work, focusing on pattern matching, typechecking, objects, and parsing.<br>
